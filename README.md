# 2402Project

This is a project for MIS 2402 By Joseph Zuzze

The site shows two different charts using ImageCharts.\
The first chart shows the count of registrations in each year that the API covers as of 5/1/2023, which is 2014-2021
The second chart shows the proportion of the dog population that the top 20 dogs make up, from a sample of 10000 dogs. It excludes "Unknown" because it is not useful


This Database for NYC was chosen because of the large amount of information it has on each dog, and the over 500,000 entries to make conclusions from.
